Laravel 7.0 is now the minimum required version of the framework.

### Predis No Longer Required

PR: https://github.com/laravel/horizon/pull/531

The default Predis prefix now starts with the app name. If you would like to continue using the old prefix, you should add `HORIZON_PREFIX="horizon:"` to your `.env` file.

The `horizon:assets` command has been renamed to `horizon:publish` to be similar to other first party packages.
